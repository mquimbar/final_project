1.We built docker using docker-compose. Then we simply ran ./smoketest.sh to run our smoketests from the 
final_project/docstrings_testing/final_project directory.
We used the Weather API from OpenWeatherMap for the current weather and got an API key from that. 
2.The variables defined in our environment: 
    - FLASK_APP=app.py
    - DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////app/db/app.db
    - REDIS_HOST=redis
    - REDIS_PORT=6379
    - MONGO_HOST=mongod
    - MONGO_PORT=27017
    - OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=""

3.The snapshot is in the smoketest_successful_run.png
